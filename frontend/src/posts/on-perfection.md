# Hello world

It's been some time. I've been learning some life lessons along the way and I thought, why not share what I've learnt?

I've shared previously that I've struggled with the concept of [Confidence](./confidence) for a long time. My lesson for myself then was that I can trust myself, and that I need to work on changing my inner monologue. I believe I have made some progress on that front.

# A sales pitch on Schema Therapy

My therapist recommended a great book to me, titled [Breaking Negative Thinking Patterns](https://www.amazon.nl/Breaking-Negative-Thinking-Patterns-Self-Help/dp/1118877713/) (no affiliate links or anything of the sort here!), which as the cover suggests, is a self help book on practicing [schema therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_therapy). I've read it through and found it to be quite effective in helping me learn what parts of me need healing. It especially focuses on how things that happened in our past, especially our upbringing, can teach us to adapt to adverse situations in unhealthy ways, and it provides some guidance on identifying when those patterns are happening and some ideas on what you can do to change those adaptations to something healthier.

I'll tell you this for free: this thing hurts. It's uncomfortable to address these things. It sucks to admit that things were not ideal, that our parents were not perfect, that bad shit happened.

I cried tears I didn't know were in me.

One of these negative thought patterns (or "modes" as the book likes to call them) that I particularly identified with was the vulnerable child mode. I noticed that the times that I felt my lowest, I felt very small and inadequate, and I remembered that I had felt exactly that way in many situations as a child.

This realisation was extremely important. It allowed me to connect with my inner child, to have compassion. I understand now exactly what I needed to feel safe and secure in those moments as a child, but now as an adult, I have the means to satisfy those needs.

**This has been key to changing my inner monologue.**

In moments where I feel low, I now notice how my inner voice changes. I get incredibly self critical, I avoid responsibility, I catastrophize the future. I can see myself starting to spiral.

But now there's another voice. This one asks questions: "Have you slept enough? Have you been eating properly? Have you been looking after yourself?" And when the answer is inevitably "no" to any one of those questions, the voice is compassionate: "But how can you expect so much of yourself if you haven't been eating properly? How can you expect to accomplish this if you haven't had enough rest?"

Critically, I allow myself to have these moments now. I accept that I cannot be perfect all the time, _and that's okay_. I can give myself a day to feel it, process what I need to do, and start the next day with perspective. I have compassion for myself, something I have always felt I've had in abundance for others, but never really figured out how to give myself.

I can think back to many instances where, while under my proverbial wing, some mentees of mine at work have made mistakes or something bad in general has happened, and I've had the perspective to see how, in 99% of cases, I could not feasibly blame them for that mistake or misfortune, and that it was simply a product of circumstance. I could not expect them to know they were making a mistake at the time, they were simply doing their best with the knowledge and experience they had at the time.

_And I'm finally starting to see that for myself!_

# Domino Effect

Once this first domino fell, I feel it has knocked some others.

In the past, I would be afraid to try something new, because what if I'm not good at it? Where now, I set my expectations much lower, and allow myself the pleasure (and pain) of being bad at something and getting better at it with practice.

In the past, I would avoid starting something unless I was completely able to plan out every outcome or possibility. This lead to me simply not doing things, and wondering why I was so bored. Where now, I can accept that I can't plan for every outcome, but I can probably trust myself to figure it out when things don't go as I expect (including asking for help!).

In the past, I would let my constant feeling of anxiety dictate my decisions, where now I understand that often times, the outcomes I'm imagining are exactly that, my imagination, and that I can allow my mind to be changed by new experiences.

And importantly, I don't expect myself to get it right every time.

There are days where I can push myself. Where I can accept difference. Where I can fail.

And there are days where everything sucks and I want nothing more than to crawl into a hole and hide forever.

**But I don't hate myself for having those days anymore.**
