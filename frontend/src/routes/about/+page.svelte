    <h2>Hi. I'm Logan.</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a full time software engineer, starting in 2013, with a strong technical background in
      .NET and MSSQL. I have a passion for helping others realise their potential and enjoy
      mentorship and elevating the abilities of my peers.
    </p>
    <p>Born in Johannesburg, South Africa, I relocated to Amsterdam, Netherlands in 2022.</p>
    <p>
      I am presently employed as a Senior Software Engineer at <a

        rel="nofollow noopener"
        target="_blank">Entelect Netherlands</a
      > but this website and the views depicted on it are entirely my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm a hobbyist photographer in my free time. I enjoy capturing depth, colour, and detail, and
      frequently use my photography to express my emotions.

    <h3>My story</h3>
    <p>
      I have been interested in computers for as long as I can remember. My parents used to call me
      square eyes because of how much time I spent in front of a computer screen. I absorb knowledge
      on topics that interest me, so I quickly learnt how to use a computer and then spent the
      greater part of my childhood gaming!
    </p>
    <p>
      I started out learning how to create maps in Warcraft III, then later on made gamemodes and
      scripts in Grand Theft Auto <a
        href="https://www.sa-mp.com/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="nofollow noopener">San Andreas Multiplayer</a
      > to play with my friends. That sparked an interest in how regular old applications were made,
      and I started teaching myself C# and C++, writing little applications just to see what I could
      do with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of high school I knew that I wanted to write code, so I applied to study Computer
      Science at a few universities. I landed up studying a Computer Systems degree through what was
      then known as CTI (which subsequently merged with Pearson Institute of Higher Education and is
      now known as <a href="https://www.eduvos.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"
        >Eduvos</a
      >).
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after figuring out how much I love code, I figured out I have a love for photography
      as well. I bought my first DSLR (A Canon EOS 1200D) for a trip to Europe in 2014 and have been
      enjoying it as a hobby since.
    </p>
    <p>I enjoy capturing images that give me inspiration and let me express my feelings.</p>
    <h3>Portfolio</h3>
    <p>
      This website is intended to be a portfolio of my creative work. It is entirely written by
      myself (save for some lovely <a
